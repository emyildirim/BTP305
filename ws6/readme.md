# Workshop 6: STL Containers

**In this workshop, I created a mini UNIX-like filesystem that supports a few common commands.**

Demonstrated key points:
- manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL
- move a dynamically allocated object into a container
- code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container
- report and handle an exception
