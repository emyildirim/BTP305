# BTP305
Object-Oriented Software Development Using C++

## My Learning Outcomes
- Design collections of model objects using sequential containers and multi-dimensional arrays to solve a complex systems or business problem.
- Create function objects and closures to customize a programming solution for a particular application.
- Model generalization and specialization using single and multiple inheritance to minimize the duplication of code in complex hierarchies.
- Model polymorphic behavior using interfaces, virtual functions and templates (generics) to amplify the reusability of code.
- Implement design components using algorithms of the standard template library to utilize existing technologies.
- Create program components of quadratic complexity to solve non-linear problems.
- Design program components using raw pointers, pointer arithmetic and smart pointers to access data in program memory.
- Design multi-tasked solutions using threading libraries to improve the performance of a program.
- Design file stream objects to backup text and binary data for future restoration.
- Trace the execution of program code that includes a linked list to debug an application.
