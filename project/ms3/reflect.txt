I love how the project is presented which is step by step with each milestone.
I have learned a lot, by practicing polymorphism and doing a bunch of logical thinking the
whole time. However the hardest part was the last milestone, the part that you need to
figure out the logic behind the output by doing tons of debugging and experimenting with logical
operators.

Overall, it was fun finishing the project and I think, it was easier than the previous class because we had passed
the hard part (OOP) so mostly it was satisfying to see your hard work pay off I guess.
