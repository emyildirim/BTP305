# Workshop 3: Templates

**In this workshop, I designed and code several class templates and test them on different instantiations.**

Demonstrated key points:
- design and code a class template
- template a class variable
- specialize a templated class variable for a particular type
- instantiate a template class
- specialize a member function of a templated class to process a particular type
- derive a templated class from another templated class
