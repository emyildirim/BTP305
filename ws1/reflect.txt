The external linkage is used for global variables
which enables all the translation units to access the variable
like other documents that have the header file can access but
in internal linkage, only the translation unit which is
the document that has been declared in can use that global variable.
So I used external keyword for g_taxrate and g_discount, and the main
function in w1_p2.cpp could able to use that global variable and could change the values.

I first encountered a problem about how to declare and initialize
the counter variable but after some realization and research,
I used a "static int counter" as a custom private member
which is declared once and for all the objects and used until
the end of the program without getting deallocated.
So I could be able to count the number of people that displayed.

I first used null terminated character array (string) then I used a std::string type object 
for m_name and m_description because std::string is allocated and deallocated by the
library. I included string library to use std::getline() in RideRequest source file because it accepts istream& and std::string
as the arguments.
