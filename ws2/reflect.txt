The difference between copy and move operations is that
copy operations require hard copy only but in move operations
you need to move the resources such as addresses and 
make a shallow copy, also delete the other's resources when you complete
moving the resources because it is basically cutting from one and
pasting to another's resource. So making a hard copy takes more time since you are
copying each value from one to another and in the move operations you are just moving resources by shallow copy.

I faced a problem while rereading the file, at first
I opened and closed the file twice, one for counting lines and the other one for reading data.
Then I realized I could clear the flags and move the cursor to the beginning of the file and 
no need for a second time to open the file.
file.clear() // sets the flags to clear
file.seek(0) // set the cursor to the beginning of the file : 0
If we do not want to reread the file I think we can dynamically expand the size of 
AirportLog array one by one each line we read and add the new data to the array. But 
it is going to take a lot of memory since each time we try to add new data we should expand the size dynamically
we need to make a tmp variable and make hard copy then resize the original array and copy back to the original from tmp.
This way we can read from the file once and each time we have new data to read, just increase the array's size by one (by resizing) and add the
new data.

steady_clock does not have any relation to daylight or calender
adjustments, it only calculates a consistent and reliable time since it
can not be modified by the user and used for performance measurements.
However, system_clock is a real-time clock that is based on real-world time 
events. It can be modified according to the location and current time.
It is used best for the current date and time.
