# Workshop 4: Containers

**In this workshop, I coded three classes that are in composition and aggregation relations.**

Demonstarted key points:
- design and code composition and aggregation class relationships
- use member functions of the string class to parse a string into tokens based on simple rules
- design and code a class that manages a dynamically allocated array of pointers to objects (double pointers)
