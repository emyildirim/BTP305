# Workshop 7: STL Algorithms

**In this workshop, I created an application that manages a collection of cities from around the world and the number of COVID cases/deaths from each city in a given year.**

Demonstrated key points:
- copy data from a file into a sequential container
- use the numeric library to accumulate data values
- use a lambda expression to specify an operation on each value in a data set
- use the algorithm library to sort data values
