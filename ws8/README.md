# Workshop 8: Smart Pointers

**In this workshop, I excluded one collection from another and use smart pointers to ensure that memory is deallocated in the possible presence of an exception.**

Demonstrated key points:
- create a program component of quadratic complexity
- use a smart pointer to move an object
